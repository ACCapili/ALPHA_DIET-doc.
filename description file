##Snacks
1.By definition, a snack is a small portion of food that is smaller than a regular meal, generally consumed between meals. Snacks are defined as smaller, less structured meal that are not eaten during regular meal times, such as breakfast (morning), lunch (midday), and dinner (evening). Snacks come in a variety of forms including fresh ingredients and packaged and processed foods.

2.Whether eating a "snack" is considered a beneficial or detrimental behavior is largely based on how "snack" is defined. The term "snack food" tends to connote energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods high in nutrients to limit (sugar, sodium, and/or saturated fat) like cakes, cookies, chips and other salty snacks, and sugar-sweetened beverages. Eating a "snack food" is often conflated with eating a "snack," however, leading to an overall perception of snacks as a dietary negative. Yet the term "snack" can also refer simply to an eating occasion outside of breakfast, lunch, or dinner. With this definition, the evidence to support health benefits or detriments to eating a "snack" remains unclear, in part because relatively few well-designed studies that specifically focus on the impact of eating frequency on health have been conducted. Despite these inconsistencies and research gaps, in much of the nutrition literature, "snacking" is still referred to as detrimental to health.

soft drinks
1.consuming soda can have the same impact on the body as drinking the eight glasses of water; despite concerns that soda has the complete opposite effect.
